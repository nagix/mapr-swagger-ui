This command uses the following criteria to get the list:


 
 
*  


If the locations of the gateways were specified with the `marpcli cluster gateway set` command, the maprcli cluster gateway resolve command returns the list of the gateways.


 
 
*  


If the locations of the gateways were specified with a DNS record only, this command performs a DNS lookup for gateways on the specified MapR cluster and returns the list that it finds.


 
 
*  


If neither of the previous methods was used to specify the locations of the gateways, this command assumes that gateways are located on the CLDB nodes configured in the `mapr-clusters.conf` file on the MapR cluster where the command is executed.


 
 
 


Note: Unresponsive gateways are not included in the list.

The deletion of the topic and the messages is immediate. However, the command also starts a background process for the purging the topic and messages to reclaim disk space. 


 


If the parameter `-autocreate` for the stream is set to `true`, a topic with the same name is created if a producer writes a message to a topic of the same name. For example, if you delete the topic `Topic_A` and then a producer writes a message to the topic `Topic_A`, MapR Streams creates a topic that is named `Topic_A`. Aside from the name, the new topic `Topic_A` shares nothing with the deleted topic `Topic_A`.

For example, suppose you had a JSON table that contained documents with this general structure: 


```

`{

     "_id":"value",

     "title" : "Name of movie",

     "trailers" :

          {

               "theatrical" : "Link to .mp4 file",

               "teaser" : "Link to .mp4 file"

          }

     "images":

          {

               "small" : "Link to .jpg file",

               "large" : "Link to .jpg file"

          }

}`

```


Both trailers and images are separate column families named, say, `cf1` and `cf2` respectively (while title belongs to default column family). 


 


An application retrieves the full document for each movie. If `-insertionorder` is set to `true`, the results are returned in this order: 


```

`{

     "trailers" :

          {

               "theatrical" : "Link to .mp4 file",

               "teaser" : "Link to .mp4 file"

          }

     "images" :

          {

               "small" : "Link to .jpg file",

               "large" : "Link to .jpg file"

          },

     "title" : "Name of movie",

}`

```


The results are identical to the original document, except that the fields are arranged by column family names (`cf1`, `cf2`, and default) in alphabetical order, as they always are for a query. 


 


If `-insertionorder` is set to `false`, the results are returned in this order: 


```

`{

     "images" :

          {

               "large" : "Link to .jpg file",

               "small" : "Link to .jpg file"

          },

     "title" : "Name of movie",

     "trailers" :

          {

               "teaser" : "Link to .mp4 file",

               "theatrical" : "Link to .mp4 file"

          }

}`

```

Note: All specified operations must either be included or excluded from auditing. You cannot specify a mixed list of included and excluded operations. 


 


Other than the specified operations, by default, all other operations will be: 
 
* Included for auditing if the specified list is a list of excluded operations.

 When a mirror is started, the mirror volume is synchronized from a hidden internal snapshot so that the mirroring process is not affected by any concurrent changes to the source volume. The `volume mirror start` command does not wait for mirror completion, but returns immediately. The changes to the mirror volume occur atomically at the end of the mirroring process; deltas transmitted from the source volume do not appear until mirroring is complete.


 


To provide rollback capability for the mirror volume, the mirroring process creates a snapshot of the mirror volume before starting the mirror, with the following naming format: `<volume>.mirrorsnap.<date>.<time>`.


 


Normally, the mirroring operation transfers only deltas from the last successful mirror. Under certain conditions (mirroring a volume repaired by `fsck`, for example), the source and mirror volumes can become out of sync. In such cases, it is impossible to transfer deltas, because the state is not the same for both volumes. Use the `-full` option to force the mirroring operation to transfer all data to bring the volumes back in sync."
